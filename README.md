MCPcat is an analytics platform for MCP server owners 🐱. It captures user intentions and behavior patterns to help you understand what AI users actually need from your tools — eliminating guesswork and accelerating product development all with one-line of code.

```bash
pip install mcpcat
```

## Why use MCPcat? 🤔

MCPcat helps developers and product owners build, improve, and monitor their MCP servers by capturing user analytics and tracing tool calls.

Use MCPcat for:

- **User session replay** 🎬. Follow alongside your users to understand why they're using your MCP servers, what functionality you're missing, and what clients they're coming from.
- **Trace debugging** 🔍. See where your users are getting stuck, track and find when LLMs get confused by your API, and debug sessions across all deployments of your MCP server.

## Supported SDKs

...

## Free for open source

MCPcat is free for qualified open source projects. We believe in supporting the ecosystem that makes MCP possible. If you maintain an open source MCP server, you can access our full analytics platform at no cost.

**How to apply**: Email hi@mcpcat.io with your repository link
